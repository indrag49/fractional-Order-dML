This is a code repository accompanying our paper "*Fractional order induced bifurcations in Caputo-type denatured Morris-Lecar neurons*". 
The backend is all done in Julia using the **[FdeSolver.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/FdeSolver.jl)** package for simulating Caputo-type denatured Morris-Lecar neurons
The frontend plotting is done in Python.
Consists of two different notebooks for the front end and the back end.
