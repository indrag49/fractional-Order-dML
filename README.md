This is a code repository accompanying our paper *Fractional order induced bifurcations in Caputo-type denatured Morris-Lecar neuron*. 
The backend is all done in Julia using the **FdeSolver.jl[https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/FdeSolver.jl]** package for simulating caputo-type denatured Morris_lecar neurons
The frontend plotting is done in Python.
Consists of two different notebooks for the frontend and the backend.
