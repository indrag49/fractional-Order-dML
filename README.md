This is a code repository accompanying our paper 

Indranil Ghosh* and Hammed Olawale Fatoyinbo, "[Fractional order induced bifurcations in Caputo-type denatured Morris-Lecar neurons](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cnsns.2025.108984)" in Commun. Nonlinear Sci. Numer. Simul., 2025.

The Preprint is available in [ArXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.17798).

The backend is all done in Julia using the **[FdeSolver.jl](https://github.com/JuliaTurkuDataScience/FdeSolver.jl)** package for simulating Caputo-type denatured Morris-Lecar neurons. The frontend plotting is done in Python. Consists of two different notebooks for the front end and the back end.
